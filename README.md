## Project Overview
Use image-detection via camera to give robocar a location or GPS coordinates to navigate  to, then use GPS data to plot path there and avoid any obstacles in the way. The robocar will be able to take any location given (provided itâ€™s in range of the network connection) and determine how to get there
